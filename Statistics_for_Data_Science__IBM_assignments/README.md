### Project Scenario:
You are a Data Scientist with a housing agency in Boston MA, you have been given access to a previous dataset on housing prices derived from the U.S. Census Service to present insights to higher management.
### Project Tasks:
#### Task 1: Familiarize yourself with the dataset 

#### Task 2: Generate basic statistics and visualizations for upper management. 
* For the "Median value of owner-occupied homes" provide a boxplot

* Provide a  bar plot for the Charles river variable

* Provide a boxplot for the MEDV variable vs the AGE variable. (Discretize the age variable into three groups of 35 years and younger, between 35 and 70 years and 70 years and older)

* Provide a scatter plot to show the relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town. What can you say about the relationship?

* Create a histogram for the pupil to teacher ratio variable
  
#### Task 3: Use the appropriate tests to answer the questions provided.
* Is there a significant difference in median value of houses bounded by the Charles river or not? (T-test for independent samples)

* Is there a difference in Median values of houses (MEDV) for each proportion of owner occupied units built prior to 1940 (AGE)? (ANOVA)

* Can we conclude that there is no relationship between Nitric oxide concentrations and proportion of non-retail business acres per town? (Pearson Correlation)

* What is the impact of an additional weighted distance  to the five Boston employment centres on the median value of owner occupied homes? (Regression analysis)
