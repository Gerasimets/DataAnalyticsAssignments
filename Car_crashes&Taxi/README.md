## Analysis of Car Crashes and Taxis Datasets 

### Overview

This project analyzes two datasets: car_crashes and taxis. The car_crashes dataset provides insights into factors contributing to fatal collisions, while the taxis dataset focuses on taxi trip data.

### Car Crashes Dataset

- **Task 1:** Graphically demonstrated the correlation between all numerical columns.
- **Task 2:** Demonstrated a percentage of drivers who were speeding per US state and the percentage of drivers who were alcohol-impaired per US state.

### Taxis Dataset

- **Task 3:** Created boxplots describing total payments depends on payments type (cash / credit card) for every passenger quantity.
- **Task 4:** Created a scatterplot showing the relationship between distance and fare; between distance and tip. Showed the distribution of distance values shown in percent.

### Methodology

- Used Python and its libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn, Plotly) for data analysis and visualization.
- Analyzed two datasets: car_crashes and taxis, sourced from an online repository.
- Removed missing values in the taxi dataset by copying the DataFrame and removing rows with NaN/None values for further analysis.
- Compared the results between cleaned and uncleaned datasets for tasks 3 and 4 to draw insights.
